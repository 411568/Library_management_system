<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Library Managment System is a program written as a university project in the C++ language. Is manages a number of students and books in a library. The "database" is made of two simple .txt files, one containing the list of all the users, while the other - books. 
The program then let's a single student log in using his university ID and check out, reserve or return any book. If the book was overdue, it will also show the required payment. 
An administrator can view all the users, books, as well as add them to the database and generate a report of all the users, with any fees they have to pay for overdue books.

To go back to the main menu you can input -1 and then write 3 to exit the program.
