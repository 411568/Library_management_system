# Library Managment System

Library Managment System is a program written as a university project in the C++ language. Is manages a number of students and books in a library. The "database" is made of two simple .txt files, one containing the list of all the users, while the other - books. \
The program then let's a single student log in using his university ID and check out, reserve or return any book. If the book was overdue, it will also show the required payment. \
An administrator can view all the users, books, as well as add them to the database and generate a report of all the users, with any fees they have to pay for overdue books.

## Compilation

The project was created using visual studio 2022 with C++ version 14 used. \
It's was programmed and tested on a windows 11 OS, and some functions will not work in other operating systems (like system("cls") for clearing the console).
